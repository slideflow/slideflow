        A.        reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for Non-Commercial purposes only; and

        B.        produce, reproduce, and Share Derivative Work for Non-Commercial purposes only; and

        C.        produce, reproduce, and Share the Results for Non-Commercial purposes only. Any use of the Results other than Non-Commercial use shall be prior approved by the Licensor.

In any case, and without limiting the foregoing, You may not use the Licensed Material for any commercial purpose, or in connection with any patent application (or similar attempts to claim an intellectual property right). You may make a reasonable number of copies of the Documentation solely for use in connection with the license to the Licensed Material granted above

    3.        Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.

The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(3) never produces Derivative Work.

    4.        Downstream recipients.

        C.        No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

    5.        No endorsement. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(b)(1)(A)(i).

b.        Other rights
